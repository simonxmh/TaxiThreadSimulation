1) Explain why you need to use synchronization tools to properly model this process. What would
happen if you did not use synchronization tools (i.e. describe a problem that would occur each time a
synchronization primitive is omitted)?

The producer-consumer problem presented here demonstrates a need for the synchronization tools used. 
The two tools that were needed were a semaphore and a mutual exclusion lock. The semaphores solve
the problem wherein there would be lost wake up calls were we to implemented the problem using an item
count to restrict items from being produced/consumed(since producer cannot add to full queue and consumer 
cannot take from empty queue). Therefore were we to not use semaphores, the producer and the consumer may 
both fall asleep due to a race condition, and lead to a deadlock. There is also an issue where the producers 
can all be trying to place items into the queue simultaneously, which leads to loss of the item as a result 
of the race condition, and this isthe problem if the mutual exclusion lock is not implemented. By using these 
synchronization tools, we ensure that the producer and consumer processes do not fall into a deadlock and have
loss of information due to race conditions.


2) Experiment with [2, 5, 10] airplanes arriving each hour and [100, 10, 2] taxis. Print out what each
taxi and airplane is doing and include that print-out in your report. Let your program run for 10 “hours”
(airplane arrivals).

The experiment results logs are all presented one by one in the accompanying files.

3) Describe any issues you may have in your code which you believe is making it run incorrectly (i.e.
any known bugs). This would you get partial marks in case your code is not fully functional.

I don't think there are any issues with the code such that it is running incorrectly.
