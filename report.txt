1) Explain why you need to use synchronization tools to properly model this process. What would
happen if you did not use synchronization tools (i.e. describe a problem that would occur each time a
synchronization primitive is omitted)?

The producer-consumer problem presented here demonstrates a need for the synchronization tools used. 
The two tools that were needed were a semaphore and a mutual exclusion lock. The semaphores solve
the problem wherein there would be lost wake up calls were we to implemented the problem using an item
count to restrict items from being produced/consumed. Therefore were we to not use semaphores, the 
producer and the consumer may both fall asleep due to a race condition, and lead to a deadlock.
There is also an issue where the producers can all be trying to place items into the queue simultaneously,
which leads to loss of the item, and this is the problem if the mutual exclusion lock is not implemented.
